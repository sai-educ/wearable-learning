			<p>We introduce a science-backed novel learning technology to support embodied mathematics educational
				games, using wearable devices such as smart phones for math learning, for full classes of students in
				formal in-school education settings.</p>

			<p>The Wearable Learning Platform is web-based infrastructure that enables students to carry one mobile
				device per child, as they embark on math team-based activities that require physical engagement with the
				environment. These Wearable Tutors serve as guides and assistants while students manipulate, measure,
				estimate, discern, discard and find mathematical objects that satisfy specified constraints.</p>

				<h3>Meet Our Team</h3>
				<p>Wearable Learning was developed by researchers at UMass Amherst and Worcester Polytechnic Institute,
					funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF awards IIS-2041785 and IIS-2026722).</p>
